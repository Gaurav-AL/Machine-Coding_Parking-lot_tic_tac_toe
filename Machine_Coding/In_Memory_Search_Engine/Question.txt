Your organisation has started a new tech blog with interesting tech stories and you're responsible 
for designing and implementing an in-memory search engine. Supporting the search functionality on the blog content.
It should support the following.
A. It should be possible to create a dataset in the search engine.
B. It should be possible to insert documents into a given dataset. Each document is simply a piece of text.
C. It should be possible to search through documents for a search pattern in a given dataset. 
A search pattern could have one or more words. When there are more words,
 all the words in the search pattern should be present anywhere in the document to match, 
 irrespective of their order. Assume that the search is case-insensitive.

Examples:

Search term: apple

Document id: Document
Doc1: apple is a fruit
Doc2: apple apple come on
Doc3: oranges are sour
Doc 4: apple is sweet
Doc 5: veggies are healthy
Result : Doc2, Doc1, Doc4
