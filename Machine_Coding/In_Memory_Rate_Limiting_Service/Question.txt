2. Design and implement an In Memory Rate Limiting Service which should rate limit the request based on the config set by admin.

Admin should be able to add configuration on user_id and route level, with only one of them as mandatory.
If the other field is not passed, it should be treated as a global limit at individual level.
 Say x req per min is the limit on /profile route without user id, in that case every user will be able to access this route x times per minute.
 Similarly if x req per min is the limit added on an user_id, then each route can be accessed x times in a min by that user.
If there is no matching rate limit configuration, the request should not be blocked. If the specific configuration is present that should be picked and not global
The service should expose one function which will either return true or false based on the limit set by the admin.
The service should be able to support below rate limiting algorithms.
Fixed Window - X req per minute. Allow x req every minute starting from zero second.
Sliding Window - X req per minutes. Allow x req in last 1 minute.
It should be able to handle concurrent requests.
